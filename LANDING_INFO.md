## Manifesto

### The Bot Garden Manifesto

**We believe in evolution, not revolution.**

Software development has become too complex. We've lost the joy of building something simple that works, then watching it grow into something amazing. Bot Garden returns to those roots.

**Every great bot starts simple.**

HB-001 greets users. That's it. But from this humble beginning, infinite possibilities emerge. AI assistants, business automation, creative tools, educational platforms - all grow from the same simple foundation.

**Collaboration accelerates evolution.**

Humans provide vision and creativity. AI provides implementation and optimization. Together, we create bots that neither could build alone. This is the future of software development.

**Community multiplies individual effort.**

Your bot evolution helps everyone. Share your genealogy, document your decisions, contribute your improvements. We all grow together.

**Production-ready means production-ready.**

No toy examples. No "getting started" tutorials that break in production. Every bot in our garden deploys successfully and runs reliably. If it's in Bot Garden, it works.

**Open source is the only sustainable path.**

Closed platforms fail. Vendor lock-in stifles innovation. Open source, community-driven development creates lasting value for everyone.

**Simplicity is sophistication.**

The most complex AI assistant starts with Hello Bot. Embrace the gradual evolution from simple to sophisticated. Every capability has its place in the genealogy.

**Welcome to Bot Garden. Let's grow something amazing together.**
